    testimonial:
      "I have got to know Roberto when he joined the telecom company I was heading. We started as a small start-up and also thanks to Roberto’s great sales management contribution in both Africa and Asia we managed to become the #1 service provider worldwide. His courage to leave Europe for Asia and his relentless sales closing in such a competitive environment always amazed me and this book explains step by step how he did it. I could not put it down! I love it, it’s quite a curved ball as there are many anecdotes I wasn’t aware of and interesting learning that can be applied to all situations in life. To me it’s a valuable record of what can be achieved by every single one of us.",

As his coach I have witnessed the change often in awe on how becoming a better athlete has tremendously impacted his everyday life. A must-read for everyone in search of a well balanced life",
